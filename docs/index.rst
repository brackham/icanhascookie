Documentation
=============

There comes a time in life when one wonders if they can have the cookie.

This is the documentation for the Python package `icanhascookie`, which may help to answer the question.

Just kidding, this is just my way of learning how to make a distributable Python package.

  icanhascookie/index.rst

.. note:: The layout of this directory is simply a suggestion.  To follow
          traditional practice, do *not* edit this page, but instead place
          all documentation for the package inside ``icanhascookie/``.
          You can follow this practice or choose your own layout.
